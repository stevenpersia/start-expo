Minimal starter kit for Expo.io project (React Native). No unnecessary packages installed, only the essentials.

- Blank project.
- TypeScript.
- Eslint.
- Babel.
- Prettier.
- Airbnb code linting.
- React Native for web.
- React navigation.

I will do more starter like this one. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
